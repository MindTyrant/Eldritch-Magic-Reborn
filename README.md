### Rebuilt Version of Eldritch Magic, Originally by AbdelAdrian
## By MindTyrant

Mod Features
    *    Congenio's Pebble Collection - Allows multiple Ioun stones to stack without using any equipment slots. WARNING: Ioun stones that use Opcode "Stat: Maximum HP Modifier [18]" work differently than others. In order for the HP modifier to be removed when the Ioun stone is, the HP modifier cannot be saved and loaded. In other words, if you save with the Pale Green Ioun Stone and/or Wong Fei's Ioun Stone equipped in orbit, you must equip them again upon loading to receive the HP modifier.
    *    Eldritch Armors - Gives the different Elven Chain suits more powers based on their enchantment level
    *    BLADESINGER KIT: Of the roving Elves, there are few as deadly as the Bladesingers of Clan Lion. They are experts in the long sword and have spent their lives studying their chosen weapon. They have also learned to cast spells while engaged in combat, and thus they double their might.
	
	Advantages:
        – +1 to hit and damage rolls. 
        – May achieve High Mastery (four slots) in long swords.
        – May use the three Bladesong abilities. Only one bladesong may be used each round, and its use does not count as your spell for the round. To receive the effects from a bladesong requires a one-handed melee weapon and an empty 
  		off-hand, and may not be used with a shield, ranged weapon, or armor heavier than chain mail. Using a bladesong removes the effects of any other bladesong, and for 8 hours provides the following effects:
    
			SONG OF DEFENSE: Grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class. This bonus improves to +2 at fighter level 11 and +3 at fighter level 21.
    
			SONG OF VICTORY: Grants a +1 to hit rolls. This improves to +2 at fighter level 11 and +3 at fighter level 21.
    
			SONG OF CELERITY: Grants a -1 bonus to Speed Factor. This bonus to Speed Factor improves to -2 at fighter level 11 and -3 at fighter level 21.
    
		– Blindfighting: Immune to blindness.
		– Counterspell: Gain a +1 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Spell. This bonus improves to +1 for every six mage levels. Maintaining counterspell makes spellcasting more difficult, giving a +2 penalty to Casting Time.
        – Arcane Fury: At mage level 5, inflicts critical damage on an attack roll of 19 or 20. 
        – Arcane Strike: At mage level 15, may make an additional attack per every other round. 
    
	Disadvantages:
        – Race restricted to Elf.
	    – Incurs an additional -1 nonproficiency penalty to hit rolls (for a total of -3).
    	– Starts with two fewer starting weapon proficiencies, earns additional weapon proficiencies every four levels instead of every three.
    	– May not exceed Proficiency (one slot) in weapons (except for long sword).
    	– May not place any slots in Single-Weapon Style.
